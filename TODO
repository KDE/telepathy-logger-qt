* Btw, you might want to use QtGLib here to avoid doing such stuff
yourself and in the wrong way. class Error could be completely
replaced with QGlib::Error for example.

* Throwing exceptions inside C callbacks is a terribly bad idea imho.
To catch exceptions, the calling code needs to have a stack compiled
with exception support (afaik), and C libraries definitely do not do
that. Most likely, the code will crash. Those callbacks are called
from the event loop anyway, so if you throw exceptions, they will be
delivered to the event loop and Qt doesn't handle exceptions very well
in there.
